# Option and Result for Kotlin

Even though Kotlin has an amazing support for Null-safety, some of the Java collections can't deal with optional values. And so the Option class was born. As for the Result - it can be useful to move a value around without throwing exceptions, especially in concurrent code. Enjoy ^_^
